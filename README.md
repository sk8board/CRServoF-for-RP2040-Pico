## CRServoF for RP2040 Pico

NOTE: This project is a work in progress for Raspberry Pi microprocessor RP2040 boards like the Pico. This project does not support other microprocessors.

CRServoF for RP2040 Pico is an RC receiver project for RC surface models that use ExpressLRS and EdgeTX.

This RC receiver has 6 PWM servo channels and 6 LED channels. EdgeTX will allow the user to customize how the LED channels can be used on the RC model

For example, the user can easily program, in EdgeTX, to have the headlights turn on with a button in the RC transmitter or have the headlights turn on automatically when the throttle is applied.

CRServoF for RP2040 Pico is a project partly from https://github.com/CapnBry/CRServoF, (which is ExpressLRS (ELRS) for STM32 micros) and partly from https://github.com/mikeneiderhauser/CRSFJoystick, (which is ExpressLRS to USB game dongle for RP2040 Pi Pico).
